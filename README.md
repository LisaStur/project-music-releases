# Music Releases
Technigo Bootcamp pair-programming project, starting to use React.
By Emelie Lönnerheden and Lisa Sturegård

## The problem
Using React to showcase Spotify new releases. Building the app with React components, using Spotify data (mimicking API).
Super fun project! 
We could not get the hover effect to work on the icnosn in Firefox though, any tips? 
And Lint is complaning about a line (11 in AlbumsContainer) exeeding "max-ength", we could not find whre to "break" it, or how to solve it. What's best practice there?
